# Calculator
Simple Calculator Project Using Python and Tkinter Function
# Python Calculator with Tkinter

A simple, user-friendly calculator built using Python and Tkinter. This project demonstrates the basics of GUI (Graphical User Interface) development with Python's Tkinter library and can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Clean and simple user interface built using Tkinter
- User input is processed and displayed in real-time
- Lightweight and easy to use

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
(https://github.com/HiteshGupta03/Calculator.git)

2. Install the required dependencies (Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python, so you usually don't need to install it separately). However, if Tkinter is not installed, you can use the following command:
   . On Ubuntu:
   sudo apt-get install python3-tk

   . On macOS:
   brew install python-tk
   
3. Navigate to the project folder:
    cd python-calculator

4.  Run the Python script:
   python calculator.py

**Usage**
After running the script, a window will appear with a calculator interface. You can use the buttons to perform arithmetic operations.

.  Numbers: Click on the buttons labeled 0-9 to enter numbers.
.  Operators: Use the buttons for +, -, *, / to perform operations.
.  Equal (=): Press the = button to calculate the result.
.  Clear (C): Press the C button to clear the current input.
